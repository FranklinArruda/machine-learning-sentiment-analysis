# Income Prediction and Sentiment Analysis – Final Assignment (*Machine Learning*)

![machine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef18e1fc-7438-49ef-a437-474be9afd81d)


This repository contains the final assignment project for the module on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Part 1**: Income Prediction using supervised machine learning.
- **Part 2**: Sentiment Analysis on social media text data using Natural Language Processing techniques.

---

## Part 1: Income Prediction (Regression Task)

### Objective
To predict a customer's annual income based on structured features such as age, education, and work class.

### Approach
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, encoded categorical variables).
- Trained and compared two regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

### Outcome
- Random Forest performed better in all metrics.
- Final model selected: **Random Forest Regressor**
- Used the model to predict the income of a new customer: **~£54,030 per year**

## Part 2: Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

### Objective
To classify the sentiment of real-world tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using Natural Language Processing techniques.

### Approach
- Sampled 10,000 tweets from a dataset containing 1.6 million entries.
- Preprocessed the tweets:
  - Removed punctuation, stopwords, and mentions
  - Normalized and cleaned the text
- Used **VADER Sentiment Analyzer** (from NLTK) for sentiment classification.
- Mapped compound scores to sentiment labels.
- Visualized sentiment distribution with bar charts.
- Compared predicted sentiments with original labels using a confusion matrix.

## Additional Features

- Well-structured notebook with clearly written markdown explanations for each step.
- Inline references to external sources used for guidance and troubleshooting.
- Embedded evaluation images and a custom illustration representing personal reflection.
- Transparent version control with descriptive commit messages tied to specific learning steps.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file).
3. Install the required libraries if not already available:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `nltk`
4. Run the following lines once to download necessary NLTK data:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

## Personal Reflection
This project was an opportunity to apply everything I’ve learned throughout the module. I made a conscious effort to apply the feedback I received from previous assignments, particularly around vague explanations. This time, I structured my notebook more clearly, added meaningful markdown commentary, and explained why I made certain decisions.

I encountered several challenges, especially with dataset loading and text preprocessing, but managed to solve them through self-directed learning and reference to official documentation and tutorials. I also included these sources in my notebook for transparency.

In the end, this wasn’t just an assignment to submit, it felt like building something meaningful. I now feel much more confident applying machine learning and sentiment analysis in real-world contexts.

## 🎥 *Optional Project Presentation*

Although a presentation was **not required** for this project, I decided to record a full walkthrough of my notebook and results as a personal challenge and a way to finish strong.
